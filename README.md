## CS ML FINAL PROJECT 

This project explores advanced machine learning techniques for spam detection,
2 focusing on algorithms like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support
3 VectorMachine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Em4
ploying NLTK and SpaCy libraries for text processing and vectorization methods
5 like Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF, the study compares these modelsâ€™ effectiveness
6 in classifying spam emails. The research aims to identify the most efficient spam
7 detection strategies by examining model performance, accuracy, precision, recall,
8 and F1-score. This comprehensive analysis contributes valuable insights to the
9 field of spam detection, offering practical solutions for enhancing email security
10 and communication efficiency in the digital era.
